# evil-module-user

This is a go program that won't work because the author of `evil-module` force-pushed a tag we
depend on.

Note that if you do get it to run, it doesn't do anything evil. If you have the "good" version of
`jrockway/evil-module`, it prints "This is a good module!". If you have the "evil" version of
`jrockway/evil-module`, it prints "This module has turned evil!"
